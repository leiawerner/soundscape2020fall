This preview is a small snippet of my entire story. It is the beginning of the story where the subject is arrested. I didn't want this scene to be over complex as it is not intended to be an overly important part of the story. I made this beginning section mainly for context. You begin by hearing sounds of the night, followed by sirens and speaking of the Miranda rights. You then hear snaps of a camera which I intended to be the taking of a mugshot. It then continues to the sounds of a cell being closed and locked. I like overlapping sounds and I enjoy simplicity as I think it sometimes speaks the loudest. I don't want all of my soundscape to be lots of overlapping and complex layering. I want to mix the two and have a balance of overlapping and single sounds. 
I plan to have one more beginning scene which includes the prisoner writing a letter to his family. This will be used to establish a timeline. I will then continue with the time jump, skipping to the year 2020 in which COVID has changed the world. The goals I have for my project are to make sure the story is cohesive and easy to understand just by listening. I want to include as little dialogue as possible, as I think the making of stories with just sound is incredible. My story is the most important part of my project. 
I also need to work on my volume aspect. I noticed that when I converted my audio to mp3 in sounded a bit different than it did in audacity and some of the sounds need to be adjusted which I will intend to fix by the next draft.
